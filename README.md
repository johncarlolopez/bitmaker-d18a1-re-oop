# 01 - Reinforcing Exercises: OOP
## Thursday, Jan 4th

Create a Location class with a name.

Create a Trip class with an array of Location instances (called stops or destinations or something similar). Define a method that lets you add locations to the trip's list of destinations.

Make several instances of Locations and add them to an instance of Trip.

Define a method in the Trip class that iterates through the list of locations and prints something similar to the following:
```
"Began trip."
"Travelled from Toronto to Ottawa."
"Travelled from Ottawa to Montreal."
"Travelled from Montreal to Quebec City."
"Travelled from Quebec City to Halifax."
"Travelled from Halifax to St. John's."
"Ended trip."
```
HINT: Ruby doesn't limit you to iterating through an array a single element at a time.
